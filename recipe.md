To start, you’ll need at least a 12-ounce mug. I suggest spraying the mug with nonstick cooking spray or greasing it with some butter so the cake doesn’t stick.

Then, you’ll whisk together the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, baking powder, and a tiny pinch of salt. Next, add the milk, oil, and vanilla extract and stir until just combined. 

Once you’ve mixed up the cake batter, you’ll pour it into your greased mug. At this point, you can add some chocolate chips for a chocolate chip mug cake. This step is optional, but I love them! 

Lastly, you’ll want to microwave the cake until the center is just set. Mine is usually perfect right at 1 minute and 15 seconds, but the cooking time will vary slightly depending on the mug you use and your microwave.
